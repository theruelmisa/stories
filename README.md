### Project Description

**Stories** is an image sharing platform that allows users to tell seasonal stories through images. It allows users to group images based on the four seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter). For now, it only caters locations with four seasons.

### Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to accomplish this project:

- ReactJS
- CSS via Styled Components
- Firebase

### Components

**Header** \* Contains the Project Title / Logo, Season Navigation Menu

**UploadForm** \* Contains the way for users to add images into the gallery

**Modal** \* Only for screen width larger than 700px. It basically opens up a modal on image click. The idea of making it available for larger screens only is based on the fact that we already see large images on mobile devices so adding a pop up modal didn't make sense for me.

**Gallery** \* Displays all the images in a 3 column grid for screens larger than 960px, 2 column grid for tablets/small laptops, 1 column for mobile phones.

## Author's Notes

- This is just an MVP--Minimum Viable Product. Current Version allows all seasons to have upload capabilities and images have not been categorized by season yet. This is pretty much to get a firm grasp on using react and firebase in one project.

- Plans to add GSAP have been set in motion.

- Already planning of adding user auth that will tie usernames to images being upload. For now, this is open to all users anonymously.
